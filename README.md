# grailed31For31
On October, 31 2019, the website Grailed released 31 pieces of rare high-end clothing for $31 each. This program was made to purchase one of these items with web automation.

# What I learned
Object-oriented programming. Each of the 31 items was stored as an object, holding its item name and its URL.

Reinforced my Selenium skills. Handling added for intense web traffic, as there would be thousands of people trying to purchase one item.

# No longer usable
The URL that was being botted is no longer bottable.
